(Backup conversations)

You now have Pixsys/hooker and Pixsys/src. Pixsys/src contains a file called 
"install.sh". It does the job. 

Invoke the attack from the Pixsys/attack folder, 
run "patcher_root" first, to patch and then run "runme_user" -- that' the 
user level thing

note, patcher_root should run with sudo, and only once -- to patch.
runme_user should run from not root.
